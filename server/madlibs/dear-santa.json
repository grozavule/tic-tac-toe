It's my job to {verb} the {noun} and take out the {noun} every day.\n\nI really hope that I am on the {adjective} list this year! I have done a lot of {adjective} things, so I think that I deserve it! I even helped {person} feed their {animal} while they were on vacation in {location}.\n\nI have a few {adjective} {holiday} wishes this year, and I would love to see a {adjective} new {noun} underneath the tree with my name on it! It would make me the happiest {noun} on the {noun}! Oh, and if you could put a {adjective} {noun} inside of my stocking. That would be {adjective} too!\n\nMerry {holiday}!"
